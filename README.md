# Machine Learning for Life Sciences
## Creator: Korede Ogundele

This repository contains machine learning algorithms focused on life sciences, blending my two degrees in biomedical science and molecular science & software engineering. All of this code is personal work that I’m genuinely excited about. As such, it covers a wide range of life science applications.


The subdirectory 'General Machine learning' holds some of the first machine learning code I wrote while taking an introductory machine learning course. It includes a variety of algorithms—like conjugate gradients, clustering, artificial neural networks and ResNets.
