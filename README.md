# Machine Learning Algorithms
## Creator: Korede Ogundele

This repository contains two subdirectories:

1. Machine Learning for Life Sciences

2. General Machine learning
This subdirectory holds some of the first machine learning code I wrote during my master's at UC Berkeley while taking an introductory machine learning course. It includes a variety of algorithmsâ€”like conjugate gradients, clustering, artificial neural networks and ResNets.
