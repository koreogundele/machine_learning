# Machine Learning for Life Sciences
## Creator: Korede Ogundele

This repository contains machine learning algorithms, packages and libraries focused on life sciences. This blends my degrees in biomedical science and molecular science & software engineering. All of this code is personal work that I’m genuinely excited about. As such, it covers a wide range of life science applications, from models that predict molecular toxicity to smaller functions that read and write SMIILES strings.


The subdirectory 'General Machine learning' holds some of the first machine learning code I wrote while taking an introductory machine learning course. It includes a variety of algorithms—like conjugate gradients, clustering, artificial neural networks and ResNets.
