# Machine Learning Algorithms
## Creator: Korede Ogundele

This repository contains two subdirectories:

1. ML for Life Sciences
This subdirectory contains machine learning algorithms focused on life sciences—perfectly blending my two degrees in biomedical science and molecular science & software engineering. All of this code is personal work that I’m genuinely excited about. While my models are limited by not having access to a supercomputer, I keep building because I believe machine learning is invaluable to life sciences, from drug discovery to oncology. 

My work in this repository has been guided by the textbook Deep Learning for the Life Sciences: Applying Deep Learning to Genomics, Microscopy, Drug Discovery, and More by Bharath Ramsundar. I am reading through the book and applying the discussed techniques.

2. General Machine learning
This subdirectory holds some of the first machine learning code I wrote during my master's at UC Berkeley while taking an introductory machine learning course. It includes a variety of algorithms—like conjugate gradients, clustering, artificial neural networks and ResNets.
