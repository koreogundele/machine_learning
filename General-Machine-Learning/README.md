# General Machine Learning Algorithms
## Creator: Korede Ogundele

During my machine learning class, I explored a diverse range of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including steepest descent, conjugate gradients, simulated annealing, clustering, ANNs, ResNets, RNNs, and LSTMs. Within this subdirectory, I showcase practical skills in developing and implementing models and applying techniques like cross-entropy loss, Bayes theorem, and regularization for optimal performance.
