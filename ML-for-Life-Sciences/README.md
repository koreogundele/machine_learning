# Machine Learning for Life Sciences!
## Creator: Korede Ogundele

In this repository are machine learning algorithms specifically for life sciences. This includes larger packages like DeepChem for cheminformatics or smaller packaged like pysmiles (read and writes SMILES strings). The folder datasets contains datasets used for the algorithms/models.



Files in this subdirectory:
- requirements.txt : file containing all the packages required for this environment

- 01_molecule_toxicity.py: builds and evaluates model for testing molecule toxicity

- 02_mnist.py: builds and evaluates CNN to use on MNIST dataset.

- 03_solubility.py: 

- pysmiles.py: brief script demonstrating uses of pysmiles package (reading & writing SMILES strings)
