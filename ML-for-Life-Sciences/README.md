# Machine Learning for Life Sciences!
## Creator: Korede Ogundele

In this repository are machine learning algorithms specifically for life sciences. The folder datasets contains (you guessed it) datasets used for the algorithms/models.

### You know what's hard?
I'm trying to use the deepchem package. The code I plan to write is so simple (not even 100 lines) but I am having a hard time figuring out package dependencies. The textbook does not offer help with this, but I found a page of the deepchem documentation that lists its dependencies. After a few deep breaths (and maybe a drink), I will return and reattempt. If successful, I will make a requirements.txt file.
